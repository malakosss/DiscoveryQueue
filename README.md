# DiscoveryQueue

Improve your Spotify playlists through this rapid method of song discovery -- Happy hunting!

## Overview

At a basic level, this program will interface with your Spotify active device and modify (add to) your queue. 

DiscoveryQueue works by having you provide a Starting Artist and then it adds the top songs from the Related Artists of your designated Starting Artist to your queue. I frequently utilized this method of song discovery (by sifting through related artists) and really wanted to find a way to automate the process. DiscoveryQueue is just that! Although I may be a bit biased, I have found that DiscoveryQueue has made my playlists much more unique, deep, and enjoyable. All while requiring me to put in less work than I previously did for similar results.

I hope that you find it equally as useful and easy to use!
