# DiscoveryQueue

Improve your Spotify playlists through this rapid method of song discovery -- Happy hunting!

## Overview

At a basic level, this program will interface with your Spotify active device and modify (add to) your queue. 

DiscoveryQueue works by having you provide a Starting Artist and then it adds the top songs from the Related Artists of your designated Starting Artist to your queue. I frequently utilized this method of song discovery (by sifting through related artists) and really wanted to find a way to automate the process. DiscoveryQueue is just that! Although I may be a bit biased, I have found that DiscoveryQueue has made my playlists much more unique, deep, and enjoyable. All while requiring me to put in less work than I previously did for similar results.

I hope that you find it equally as useful and easy to use!

## Key Considerations for Getting Started

From my testing with some friends of mine, I have found that there are some common pitfalls that may prove to be obstacles:

*(1)* **Keep in mind that your browser or anti-virus will most likely think whichever .zip you download is a virus.** For what it's worth, I can tell you that it is not. Please see "Program Walkthrough" to see screenshots of the program in action and the DiscoveryQueue.py file to see the exact lines that will be run by the .exe.

*(2)* **I'd recommend that you export the Windows or macOS .zip to a folder that includes the .exe file.** The .exe file will produce a user.cache file that will house your permission token (that gives the program permission to alter your queue).

*(3)* **Don't be alarmed if/when the program kicks you out to your browser and asks you to login to your Spotify account.** It will ask you to allow the program to modify your queue. You must provide permission so that the program can do it thing.

*(4)* **It is critical that you have a device (i.e., phone or laptop) actively playing music on Spotify to allow the program to work.** This essentially sets your "Active Device" which the program will coordinate with to add to your queue. If you don't have music playing, then the program won't be able to add to the queue. *(THIS IS THE MOST COMMON ISSUE)*

*(5)* **Be sure to fullscreen the application so you can make the most of the logo/title.** :)
